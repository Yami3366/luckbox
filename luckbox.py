# luckbox.py
# Write a program with two compilation errors, a runtime error and a logical error.
# Next to each error, add a comment that explains what type of error it is and why it occurs.
# 3-Feb-2024 the last update.
# 20-Feb-2024 Version update 
# 1. Add the default value of the prize to test the program 
# 2. coding style referece  https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#comments and revised
# 3. The program interface  logic and operations impove
# 21-Feb-2024 validate input prize_count and participant_count
